# Breast Cancer Classification Using Logistic Regression  

This repository contains a machine learning model for **breast cancer classification** using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The model predicts whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on medical features from datasets like the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- 🔍 Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification  
- 📈 Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- 🖼️ Visualizations for better understanding of predictions  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  

## 📌 Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-classification.git
   cd breast-cancer-classification
